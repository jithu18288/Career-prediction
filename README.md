This project aims to provide career recommendations to students based on their academic performance, attendance, and extracurricular activities. It utilizes machine learning techniques to predict the probability of various career paths for students.

Overview
The system consists of two main components:

Backend (Python in Jupyter Notebook):
The backend is responsible for data preprocessing, model training, and prediction.
Jupyter Notebook is used to develop and run the backend code.
It includes data analysis, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation.
Frontend (Streamlit in Spyder Application of Anaconda Navigator):
The frontend provides a user-friendly interface for students to input their academic scores, attendance, and extracurricular activities.
Streamlit is used to create interactive web applications directly from Python scripts.
Spyder Application of Anaconda Navigator provides a development environment for running the Streamlit application.
Features
Input Form: Students can input their academic scores, attendance, and extracurricular activities through an intuitive form.
Career Recommendation: Based on the input provided by the student, the system predicts the probability of various career paths.
Visualization: Visualizations are provided to help students understand the factors influencing their career recommendations.
